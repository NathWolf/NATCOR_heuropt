        "MILP is a mathematical language for modelling optimisation problems.\n",
        "Each 'program' (or formulation) consists of a set of decision variables, constraints (equalities or inequalities) and an objective function (a formula).\n",
        "Decision variables can be continuous or integer (hence the name of the language).\n",
        "Most commonly, we use binary variables, i.e. integer variables with only two possible values: 0 and 1.\n",
        "The constraints and the objective function use decision variables in arbitrary formulas.\n",
        "However, for a program to be linear, we need to ensure that the constraints and the objective function have to be linear.\n",
        "Solvers such as CPLEX and Gurobi are primarily designed for linear programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "To develop an MILP model, you need to follow these steps:\n",
        "1. Decide on the decision variables.\n",
        " Decision variables should encode a solution to your problem.\n",
        " For the shortest path problem, the solution is a path, hence they should encode a path within the given graph.\n",
        " Once you know the values of all the decision variables, you should be able to restore the solution (the path in our example).\n",
        " Also, you should be able to encode any feasible solution to your problem with those decision variables.\n",
        "\n",
        " This is arguably the hardest part of the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define the constraints via the decision variable.\n",
        " Assuming that the decision variables that you defined in the first step are $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_{100}$, the following is an example of a constraint:\n",
        " $$\n",
        " x_5 - 3 x_{12} \\le 40.\n",
        " $$\n",
        " By defining such a constraint, you request that $x_5 - 3 x_{12}$ should never exceed 40.\n",
        " Here is another example, more relevant to the shortest path problem:\n",
        " $$\n",
        " x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 1.\n",
        " $$\n",
        " If the $x$-variables are binary then the above constraint requests that exactly one of the five variables has value 1 and the rest of them should have value 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define the objective.\n",
        " The objective can be to minimise something or to maximise something.\n",
        " As the shortest path problem is a minimisation problem, you will need to minimise the objective function.\n",
        " An example of an objective:\n",
        " $$\n",
        " \\text{minimise } 4 x_3 - x_{15}.\n",
        " $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that MILP is a declarative language; you describe the problem – not the algorithm.\n",
        "Specifically, using a mathematical language, you describe a solution (what decision variables encode it), the constraints (what makes a solution feasible) and the objective function (what needs to be minimised or maximised), and then the solver automatically does the job for you.\n",
        "This is a very powerful approach to solving optimisation problems, and this is how most of the optimisation problems are solved outside academia."
